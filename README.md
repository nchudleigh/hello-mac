# Mac App Directory

This repository lists several macOS apps with minimal configuration files and a simple webpage to browse and download them. Each app lives in its own folder inside `apps/` containing:

- `config.json` – the app name and download link
- `icon.svg` – a placeholder icon due to limited network access

Open `index.html` in a browser to see the searchable list in a grid layout. Click any app card to visit the download page. Icons can be replaced with official artwork once available.
